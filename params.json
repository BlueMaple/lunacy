{"name":"Lunacy","tagline":"Survive in a village menaced by werewolves!","body":"In Lunacy, you and your friends assume the roles of townsfolk. However, hidden among the innocent civilians are werewolves. Every night, the werewolves devour one of the civilians, and every day the civilians elect to hang one of their own, in a desperate attempt to save themselves.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the civilians aren’t completely helpless. Some of the townsfolk, such as the hunter, the seer and the priest have abilities of their own that they can use to kill or unmask the werewolves, or protect their comrades.\r\n\r\nLocked in this struggle for survival, only your wits and luck can save you.\r\n\r\n**[![Available in the Chrome Web Store](https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/images/branding/ChromeWebStore_Badge_v2_206x58.png)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lunacy-2/cmojlidobdahllkcpldacagkifpiaolh)**\r\n\r\n## Game support\r\n\r\nIf you need help with the official Lunacy game, email [the Lunacy team](mailto:support@playlunacy.com).\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n**Development**: [Sander Dijkhuis](http://sanderdijkhuis.nl/)\r\n\r\n**Artwork and text**: [Alexander Ariese](http://aliradicali.com/)\r\n\r\n**Based on the original games by**: Andrew Plotkin ([Werewolf game](http://www.eblong.com/zarf/werewolf.html)), Dimma Davidoff ([Mafia game](http://web.archive.org/web/19990302082118/http://members.theglobe.com/mafia_rules/))\r\n\r\n**Thanks to**: Simon Willems, Rosalie Jansen, Valeria Boshnakova\r\n\r\n## Open source\r\n\r\nLunacy’s source code is licensed under an Apache 2.0 license.
